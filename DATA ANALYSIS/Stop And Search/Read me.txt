 By meticulously examining the data, I aim to identify any potential biases or disparities in law enforcement practices. Through statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, I strive to develop predictive models that can estimate the likelihood of a particular outcome based on variables such as race or gender. This work is instrumental in promoting fairness and transparency within the criminal justice system, as it sheds light on any potential discriminatory practices and paves the way for evidence-based reforms.Additionally, factors like the location, date, and time of the stop, as well as the reason for the search, are crucial for contextualizing the data. Other variables might include the outcome of the stop, whether contraband was found, the duration of the encounter, and any additional actions taken by law enforcement.
