
I analyzed and predicted data breaches using Python and Power BI, I harnessed the power of these tools to gain deep insights into cybersecurity. With Python's versatile capabilities, I explored breach datasets, identified vulnerabilities, and uncovered patterns. Power BI complemented my analysis by transforming data into visually appealing dashboards, allowing stakeholders to grasp the breach landscape and make informed decisions. Together, Python and Power BI enabled me to not only analyze historical data but also build predictive models, empowering organizations to proactively safeguard their data and enhance their cybersecurity defenses.
